# Firebase Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating Benchlot from Supabase to Firebase, addressing previous implementation issues and ensuring a clean, maintainable codebase.

## Migration Approach

### 1. Learn from the Repository
- Use both main and image-handling-redesign branches to understand core requirements
- Identify data models and business logic needed
- Note UI components and user flows
- Understand previous implementation pitfalls to avoid

### 2. Clean Implementation with Firebase Best Practices
- Build components from scratch following Firebase patterns
- Avoid directly porting problematic code
- Focus on maintainable, properly structured code
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### 3. Prioritize Core Functionality
- Start with tool listings and marketplace functionality
- Implement proper image handling (learning from image-handling-redesign branch)
- Add user management capabilities
- Integrate Stripe for payments/connected accounts
- Set up SendGrid for transactional emails
- Deploy to Vercel

### 4. Iterative Testing
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
- Ensure proper Firebase security rules
- Verify all functionality works as expected

## Implementation Order
1. ✅ Tool Listings & Image Handling
2. ✅ Marketplace/Browsing Functionality
3. ⏳ Stripe Integration
4. ⏳ SendGrid Email Integration
5. ⏳ Security Rules & Deployment

## Notes
- We are not migrating data from Supabase
- This is a clean implementation with no backwards compatibility requirements
- Focus on Firebase best practices rather than replicating previous patterns
