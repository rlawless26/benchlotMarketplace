## Recent Deployment & Environment Setup (4/18/2025)

We have successfully configured a complete deployment pipeline with multiple environments:

### Environment Setup Completed
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Local development with environment detection
- ✅ **Staging Environment**: Connected to the staging branch for testing
- ✅ **Production Environment**: Connected to the main branch for live deployment

### Environment Features
- Environment-specific configuration for API endpoints and services
- Automatic deployment through GitHub integration
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions for testing
- Branch-based deployments (staging → Preview, main → Production)
- Visual environment indicator for development

### Deployment Workflow
1. Develop and test features locally (Development)
2. Push changes to staging branch for integration testing (Staging)
3. Merge staging to main when ready for release (Production)
4. Automatic deployment triggered by GitHub pushes

### Technical Implementation
- Environment detection based on URL and explicit settings
- Environment-specific build commands
- Removed hardcoded credentials in favor of environment variables
- Implemented proper Firebase configuration for all environments
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

This setup ensures a smooth, consistent deployment process while maintaining separate environments for development, testing, and production.
