# Guest Checkout Implementation Summary

## Problem

The production site was experiencing a "Cart not found" error when processing guest checkout payments. This happened because:

1. Guest carts exist only in localStorage on the client side
2. The server-side Firebase Functions expected to find a cart document in Firestore
3. When processing a payment for a guest cart, the server couldn't find the cart and returned a 404 error

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated the Firebase Function `/create-payment-intent` endpoint to:
- Detect guest checkout requests using `isGuestCheckout` flag and `cartId === 'guest-cart'`
- For guest checkout, extract cart items and total directly from the request payload
- Create a payment intent using this data without trying to look up a cart in Firestore
- Add metadata to the payment intent marking it as a guest checkout

### 2. Updated the Firebase Function `/confirm-payment` endpoint to:
- Handle guest checkout orders similar to the payment intent endpoint
- Create an order document in Firestore directly from the guest cart data in the request
- Properly handle metadata to ensure the payment intent reflects guest checkout status
- Improve error handling and logging for better debugging

### 3. Created documentation:
- Added `GUEST_CHECKOUT.md` explaining how the guest checkout flow works
- Created a test script (`test-guest-checkout.js`) to verify the implementation

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **StripeCheckout component:**
   - When `isGuestCheckout` is true, it includes the full cart data in the API requests
   - Prepares cart items and total from localStorage for submission to the API

2. **Firebase Functions:**
   - Added a special flow for guest checkout that bypasses Firestore cart lookup
   - Directly creates payment intents and orders from the request payload
   - Adds proper metadata to track guest orders

3. **Testing:**
   - Verified both endpoints handle guest checkout correctly
   - Created a test script to validate the API endpoints

## Benefits

1. Guest users can now successfully complete checkout without errors
2. No need to create temporary Firestore documents for guest carts
3. Cleaner implementation that separates guest and authenticated checkout flows
4. Better error handling and logging for future debugging

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing order association if a guest user later creates an account
2. Add email confirmation for guest orders
3. Allow guest users to look up their orders by email address or order ID
