## Project Structure

- `/src/firebase` - Core Firebase configuration and services
  - `config.js` - Firebase initialization and service exports
  - `hooks/useAuth.js` - Authentication hook for React components
  - `models/toolModel.js` - Tool data models and Firestore functions
  - `index.js` - Entry point for Firebase modules

- `/src/components` - React components
  - `AuthForm.js` - Authentication form for Firebase auth
  - `ImageComponent.js` - Reliable image handling with fallbacks
  - `ToolImage.js` - Tool image display component
  - `ToolListingCard.js` - Card display for tool listings
  - `ToolListingForm.js` - Form for creating/editing tool listings
  - `ToolDetail.js` - Detailed view of a tool listing
  - `MyListings.js` - User's own tool listings management
  - `Marketplace.js` - Main marketplace page
  - `ToolGrid.js` - Grid display for tool listings

## Development

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application will run on http://localhost:3000.

## Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for:

- Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Storage (for images)
- Analytics (coming soon)
- Functions (for Stripe and SendGrid integration)

The Firebase configuration is loaded from environment variables with fallbacks for development.

## Next Steps

- Implement Stripe integration for payments
- Set up SendGrid for email notifications
- Configure Firebase security rules
